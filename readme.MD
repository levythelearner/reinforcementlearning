# Reinforcement Learning Task - CS188

This repository contains the code for the reinforcement learning task as part of CS188 at UC Berkeley. The task specifications can be found on the [CS188 UC Berkeley website](http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html).

## Code Details

- Language: Python 3.9.15
- Authors: Le Vy and Nguyen Thi Dieu Chi
- Date: May 2023

## Introduction

The code in this repository implements the reinforcement learning task assigned as part of CS188. The task focuses on developing an agent capable of learning and making optimal decisions in an environment.

## Contents

File you'll edit:
- `valueIterationAgents.py`: Contains the implementation of the value iteration agent, which is an offline planner that performs value iteration to compute optimal value estimates for each state.
- `qlearningAgents.py`: Contains the implementation of the Q-learning agent, which is an online planner that learns Q-values for each state-action pair.
- `analysis.py`: Contains the code for the analysis of the performance of the value iteration agent and the Q-learning agent.


## Requirements

- Python 3.9.15: Ensure you have Python 3.9.15 or above installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/levythelearner/reinforcementlearning
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd reinforcementlearning
```
